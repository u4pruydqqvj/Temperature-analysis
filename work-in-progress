# Notes on Coordinate Validation (Unfinished)

Still trying to figure out how the validator script checks whether our
results match the reference output. The TA mentioned that the tool 
doesn’t compare the raw coordinates directly — it apparently uses
some kind of “central point” between two sources.

Not sure what that means yet.

---

## What I wrote down during the lecture:

- "final value comes from the space *between* the two readings"
- "don’t trust either coordinate alone"
- "use the middle ground to remove solver noise"

I think the instructor was trying to say that when two sensors disagree
slightly, the software averages them out to get a stable reference
point.

So apparently the system uses something like a midpoint?  
Not sure if that’s literal or just conceptual, but I’m noting it here 
before I forget.

---

## TODO:
- confirm whether midpoint == (lat1+lat2)/2 and (lon1+lon2)/2
- check if W3W anchors resolve consistently across devices
- compare with the older notes from the Medium write-up

If anyone else in class figures this out before I do, please ping me.
